The general objective of this project is to gain some practice on html and css basics (and refresh on git).

Objective/practice: Build a Google Hompage clone (from hence fort ghp)

Specifics: It just needs to have the same elements that the ghp has and look as similar as i'm willing to make it (obviously the minimum is pretty much every element inside the cache version)

So far i stablished the general outline of the project and included every element inside the page from now on i need to style it, that is fix the position of the elements and make the navbar sticky.

- [ ] position elements
- [ ] style nabvar top
- [ ] copy style from nabvar top to nabvar bottom and adjust
- [ ] add search bar styling
- [ ] in the nabvar top there is a link that is styled as a menu icon, reproduce if possible
